# Jelly-Cube
Jelly Cube is a three dimensional matrix of cubes that responses to sound.
It requires access to a microphone and is run through the browser. The project 
was designed using p5.js and WebGL. All files can be found in the jelly_cube dir.
To run locally open the index.html file in your web browser using
Brackets (http://brackets.io/) or a prefered webserver.

This project is also hosted on my openprocessing page (https://www.openprocessing.org/user/66638/#sketches) where you can find more of my javascript and webgl projects.
